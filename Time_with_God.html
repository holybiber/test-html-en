<h1>Time with God</h1>
<p>If we want to know a person, we need to have regular contact with them. It’s the same in our relationship with God: To get to know Him better, we need to make the time to spend with Him.
</p>
<h2>The purpose of our time with God</h2>
<ul><li><b>To worship God:</b> God is worthy of our praise and deserves our time.</li>
<li><b>To talk with God:</b> In prayer, we share with Him what is on our hearts. We listen to Him so that He can speak to us and lead us.</li>
<li><b>To learn from God:</b> God wants to teach us through His Word, the Bible, and His Spirit. This is like spiritual food for us so that we can grow.</li></ul>
