</p>
<ul><li>There is a big problem in our lives: Sin.</li>
<li><i>What is sin?</i> Stealing, lying, killing... (breaking the Ten Commandments) is sin.</li>
<li>But God’s standard is even higher:
<ul><li>Thinking badly about someone else is sin.</li>
<li>If you know the right thing to do but don’t do it, that’s sin.</li>
<li>The root of sin: Thinking we know better than God, ignoring Him, and refusing His love.</li></ul></li>
<li>God is holy and He desires us to be perfect.</li>
<li>Imagine that someone could make a video clip with all your sins: with all your mean deeds, all your dirty thoughts and all the situations where you thought nobody was watching. How would you feel if that came to light and others could see the video clip?</li>
<li>God doesn’t ignore these things but the consequence of sin is punishment.</li>
<li>Our sins cause us to be broken, spiritually dead and separated from God.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Two_Twins">The Two Twins</span></h2>
<p>There were two identical twins. One of them strayed from the right path as a teenager. He joined a gang and had no contact with his family anymore. Eventually he became a murderer. On a raid, he shot a person who got in his way. In court, he saw his brother again for the first time in years. His brother was the judge! “Great, it’s my brother!” he thought, “he should still love me! He’ll get me out of here.”<br />
His brother, the judge, passed the sentence – the death penalty! The twin brother was angry. “Why so strict?!”, he asked, “that’s not loving!” But the judge had to stick to the law to fulfill justice.
</p><p>The sentenced twin was sitting on death row when suddenly, in the middle of the night, the door opened. It was his twin brother! At first he was angry with him. “Why did you sentence me to death?!”, he demanded.<br />
“I had to; I’m just. But I have an offer for you. We both look the same. Let’s change clothes. I’ll stay here and you can go.”<br />
“Okay, great!”, the twin said, and left the prison. He celebrated the whole night because he was so happy. The next morning he remembered, “Wait a second, the execution was scheduled at 9 o’clock this morning.” He walked to the prison walls and suddenly heard a shot! He realized that his brother really had taken his punishment! He was totally desperate. He went to his brother’s house and found a letter from him. It read, 
</p><p>“You’re free. I took your punishment. I want you to live my life from now on, to be honest, and to remember what I did for you.”
