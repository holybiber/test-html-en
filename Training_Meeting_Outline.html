<h1>Training Meeting Outline</h1>
<p>Make sure that you meet with your group consistently weekly or bi-weekly. Take time for preparation for each meeting, pray for each person and ask God what he wants to say to you about the next group meeting.
</p><p>It is helpful to put the <a href="/The_Three-Thirds_Process/en">diagram of the three-thirds process</a> in the middle so you can follow it. Explain why you do this by going through the three most important commands.<br/>
It is good to plan about two hours for a training meeting and the following time spans are based on two hours total time. But if necessary you can also do it in less time and maybe skip out the non-bold parts. Either way it's important to watch the time so that you have enough time for each part and every third gets roughly a third of the time.
</p>
<h2>First third: Loving people</h2>
<p><i>Sharing, evaluating, solving problems and supporting each other (about 40 minutes)</i>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap">15 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>1. How are you?</b> (Pastoral care): Take time to listen to what is happening in each person's life. When someone shares specific needs, take a moment to plan how to practically help and pray for this topic.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap">15 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>2. Accountability:</b> Ask every person to share how well they achieved the goals they set last time. As an alternative you could also ask the following two questions based on Matthew 4:19:<br/>
<p><i>Fishing: How did you share with others about God last week?</i><br/>
<i>Following: How did you follow what God taught you last week?</i><br/><br/>
When someone shared his or God's story with someone else, ask how it went. For those in your group who are leading another group themselves, ask them periodically how their groups are doing and support them in solving problems.<br/>
In your role as the leader, don't forget to share how you did with your goals just like everyone else. Make sure you create an open and encouraging atmosphere, where everyone can honestly share his successes as well as his failures.

<td><b>3. Vision:</b> Casting vision means to paint the picture of what is possible for God and the potential he sees in everyone. This is to encourage them to apply what they have learned and give them motivation and direction for the training process. Figuratively speaking, the focus of our eyes can quickly move down to our feet and the dirt and stones directly in front of us. Lift the focus up to God's perspective and give ideas what our next steps could be.<br/>
<p>You could use vision casting vignettes from others or share your personal thoughts for that particular group. If possible, be creative and use media or other means to make your points stick.

<h2>Second third: Loving God</h2>
<p><i>Growing in our relationship with God (about 40 minutes)</i>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap">15 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>4. Worship:</b> Praise God and express your gratefulness and adoration to him â€“ with or without music. It is important to make sure you show a simple and reproducible means of how to lead worship (e.g. a cappella worship, use youtube or other recorded worship songs, read a psalm and say thanks inspired by it, ...)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap">25 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>5. Lesson:</b> Teach the lesson and clarify any questions they have. Alternatively, you could read a Bible passage together and ask what we can learn from it (you could use the <a href="/Bible_Reading_Hints/en">discovery Bible study questions</a>). Make sure that this part doesn't get too long at the cost of the practice part.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>Third third: Making disciples</h2>
<p><i>Preparing for application and multiplication (about 40 minutes)</i>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;text-align:right">25 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>6. Practice:</b> If the lesson has a specific application, do it in this part (<a href="/My_Story_with_God/en">My Story with God</a>: write it down now; <a href="/Prayer/en">Prayer</a>: practice the different types of prayer etc). Alternatively, you can have everyone practice this lesson by teaching each other in groups of two. The aim is that everyone gets comfortable in the contents of the lessons and is then able to train others in it.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;text-align:right">5 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>7. Setting goals:</b> Give everyone time to think, pray and set personal goals. Then everyone shares his goals in the group.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;text-align:right">10 Minutes
</td>
<td><b>8. Prayer:</b> Pray for each other: for God's power to apply what you learned, for the leading of the Holy Spirit, for personal issues, etc. You could pray as a whole group together or split up into smaller groups.

<h2>The bold parts</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/The_Three-Thirds_Process/en">diagram of the three-thirds process</a>, some parts are printed in bold face: accountability, vision, practice, setting goals and prayer. These are the essential parts which should never be left out. They are crucial to seeing reproducing groups and disciples making disciples making disciples...<br/>
If you are short in time, you could leave out some of the non-bold parts. It might feel strange, but you can also leave out the lesson part! Then you practice a previous lesson so that everyone becomes more comfortable in it.
